# ZOMG! CAT HEALTH!

## Hearken's Challenge

A Rails application to display two random cats on the homepage, where anyone can vote on either. After voting, the page refreshes with another pair to choose from. The admin side consists of CRUD functionality for cat, vote and user objects. The cat index allows you to sort all cats by votes in either descending or ascending order, using JavaScript. With the vote index, you can download a csv file with all votes and their urls, ip addresses of the voters, and chosen vote. RSpec and Jasmine tests were included as best as I could. I've left few pending with an explanation.

I've designed an interface and thought about UX.
